# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not - [Kaggle Getting Started Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview)

## Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.
